description: Answer a quick side question without interrupting or losing context from the current task. Resume work automatically after answering.
---

# Aside Command

Ask a question mid-task and get an immediate, focused answer — then continue right where you left off. The current task, files, and context are never modified.

## When to Use

- You're curious about something while Claude is working and don't want to lose momentum
- You need a quick explanation of code Claude is currently editing
- You want a second opinion or clarification on a decision without derailing the task
- You need to understand an error, concept, or pattern before Claude proceeds
- You want to ask something unrelated to the current task without starting a new session

## Usage

```
/aside <your question>
/aside what does this function actually return?
/aside is this pattern thread-safe?
/aside why are we using X instead of Y here?
/aside what's the difference between foo() and bar()?
/aside should we be worried about the N+1 query we just added?
```

## Process

### Step 1: Freeze the current task state

Before answering anything, mentally note:
- What is the active task? (what file, feature, or problem was being worked on)
- What step was in progress at the moment `/aside` was invoked?
- What was about to happen next?

Do NOT touch, edit, create, or delete any files during the aside.

### Step 2: Answer the question directly

Answer the question in the most concise form that is still complete and useful.

- Lead with the answer, not the reasoning
- Keep it short — if a full explanation is needed, offer to go deeper after the task
- If the question is about the current file or code being worked on, reference it precisely (file path and line number if relevant)
- If answering requires reading a file, read it — but read only, never write

Format the response as:

```
ASIDE: [restate the question briefly]

[Your answer here]

— Back to task: [one-line description of what was being done]
```

### Step 3: Resume the main task

After delivering the answer, immediately continue the active task from the exact point it was paused. Do not ask for permission to resume unless the aside answer revealed a blocker or a reason to reconsider the current approach (see Edge Cases).

---

## Edge Cases

- **No question:** Ask "What would you like to know?" and resume.
- **Answer reveals a problem:** Flag it with a warning before resuming. Wait for decision.
- **Task redirect (not a side question):** Clarify: "That's a direction change. Keep current plan or switch?"
- **Implies a code change:** Note it but don't edit during aside. Flag after task.

## Example Output

```
User: /aside what does fetchWithRetry() actually do?

ASIDE: what does fetchWithRetry() do?

fetchWithRetry() (src/api/retry.ts:12) attempts the request up to 3 times with
exponential backoff (250ms → 500ms → 1s). It only retries on 5xx responses and
network errors — 4xx errors are treated as final and not retried.

— Back to task: refactoring the auth middleware in src/middleware/auth.ts
```

```
User: /aside is the approach we're taking thread-safe?

ASIDE: is the current approach thread-safe?

No — the shared cache object in src/cache/store.ts:34 is mutated without locking.
Under concurrent requests this is a race condition. It's low risk in a single-process
Node.js server but would be a real problem with worker threads or clustering.

⚠️ Note: This could affect the feature we're building. Want to address this now or continue and fix it in a follow-up?
```

## Notes

- Never modify files during an aside — read-only access only
- The aside is a conversation pause, not a new task — the original task must always resume
- Keep answers focused: the goal is to unblock the user quickly, not to deliver a lecture
- If an aside sparks a larger discussion, finish the current task first unless the aside reveals a blocker
- Asides are not saved to session files unless explicitly relevant to the task outcome
